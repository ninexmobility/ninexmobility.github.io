## Hi! My name is Will!
---
I’ve been fascinated by radio frequency since before I can remember. I guess it all started with taking apart radios, phones and walkie-talkies as a kid growing up in the 80’s. From closed system RF & CATV, to IP Networking, WiFi, CDMA, GSM, & LTE and the devices that transmit and receive them, I love it all.

Today I’m just as disruptive, but in a much cooler way. I build and maintain scalable, hardened platforms that secure and manage the mobile phones, tablets and laptop computers that drive todays mosst innovative technologies.

I absolutely love working at companies where I am surrounded by talented people, and cutting edge technology. I’ve had the great pleasure of working for some of the best companies in the world. I cut my teeth in RF as a System Tech at TCI Cablevision (now Time Warner) before the birth of the internet. Since then I’ve worked for Nortel Bay Networks, Samsung, Apple, Honeywell, Southwest Airlines and Uber.

When I'm not at work, I’m chillin’ at home with my wife and kids, camping or teaching myself something new. I’m currently learning Python, Ruby, Chef, Puppet & Jekyll.  I'm also an amature DJ & voice over performer specializing in Audio Books.

I’m always interested in connecting with cool people who like to do fun stuff with computers. Reach out and tell me what you’re working on, maybe we can learn from each other!
